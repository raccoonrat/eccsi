This directory contains simple implementations of the following functionality:

    PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator)
    MSDB (Mikey-Sakke Database)

I would expect both of these SHOULD be rewritten by users/implementors. Why?

    o PRNG may require to be changed to enforce compliance with specific 
      policies and/ or mechanisms.

    o MSDB may require to be changed to a specific database or other 
      storage mechanisms.

I hope that by having these separated out here (i.e. not squirreled away deep 
inside the rest of the code) gives a clearer indication between 'what you 
SHOULD change', and, 'what you can look at, but probably don't need to change'.

The simple examples I provide here for PRNG and MSDB are just that, simple 
examples, i.e. I really haven't spent much time on them.
